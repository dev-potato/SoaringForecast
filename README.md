Display weather info from aviationweather.gov

Aviation weather xsd downloaded from https://aviationweather.gov/adds/schema/.

Used jaxb xjc command to initially create weather POJO classes then editted to fit to simplexml format. (This was faster than using other code generators I found that were available on the web.)
